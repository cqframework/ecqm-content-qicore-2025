More complex calculations (such as medication request period or dispense period\ncalculation) need specific guidance and consideration. That guidance may make use of this function, but\nthe focus of this function is on single element calculations where the semantics are unambiguous.\nIf the input is a DateTime, the result a DateTime Interval beginning and ending on that DateTime.\nIf the input is a Quantity, the quantity is expected to be a calendar-duration interpreted as an Age,\nand the result is a DateTime Interval beginning on the Date the patient turned that age and ending immediately before one year later.\nIf the input is a DateTime Interval, the result is the input.\nIf the input is a Quantity Interval, the quantities are expected to be calendar-durations interpreted as an Age, and the result\nis a DateTime Interval beginning on the date the patient turned the age given as the start of the quantity interval, and ending\nimmediately before one year later than the date the patient turned the age given as the end of the quantity interval.\nIf the input is a Timing, an error will be thrown indicating that Timing calculations are not implemented. Any other input will reslt in a null DateTime Interval\n*/\ndefine fluent function toInterval(choice Choice<DateTime, Quantity, Interval<DateTime>, Interval<Quantity>, Timing>):\n  case\n\t  when choice is DateTime then\n    \tInterval[choice as DateTime, choice as DateTime]\n\t\twhen choice is Interval<DateTime> then\n  \t\tchoice as Interval<DateTime>\n\t\twhen choice is Quantity then\n\t\t  Interval[Patient.birthDate + (choice as Quantity),\n\t\t\t  Patient.birthDate + (choice as Quantity) + 1 year)\n\t\twhen choice is Interval<Quantity> then\n\t\t  Interval[Patient.birthDate + (choice.low as Quantity),\n\t\t\t  Patient.birthDate + (choice.high as Quantity) + 1 year)\n\t\twhen choice is Timing then\n      Message(null, true, 'NOT_IMPLEMENTED', 'Error', 'Calculation of an interval from a Timing value is not supported') as Interval<DateTime>\n\t\telse\n\t\t\tnull as Interval<DateTime>\n\tend"

  "rationale": "Problems in the outpatient referral and consultation process have been documented, including inadequate care pathways between specialty and primary care. Studies suggest that both specialists and primary care providers (PCPs) are not satisfied with current processes (Institute for Healthcare Improvement / National Patient Safety Foundation, 2017; Greenwood-Lee et. al, 2018). Breakdowns in referral communication leads to worse health outcomes, increased cost, and appointment delays (Patel et. al, 2018; Odisho et. al, 2020. A 2018 analysis of primary care referrals to specialists found that of the 103,737 referral scheduling attempts analyzed, only 36,072 (34.8%) resulted in documented complete appointments, defined by the specialty clinician providing report to the PCP after the referral visit (Patel et. al, 2018). \n\nTechnological and process-based updates can improve the referral loop process and increase rates of closing the referral loop. Ramelson et. al (2018) enhanced an EHR's Referral Manager module to meet the Controlled Risk Insurance Company’s best practice steps and the requirements of both the CMS EHR Incentive Program and the National Committee for Quality Assurance Patient-Centered Medical Home program. Following the updates, 76.8% of referrals were completed and all defined referral process steps were easier to accomplish. Odisho et. al (2020) developed a referrals automation software to simplify the fax to referral process. Feedback from key stakeholder interviews noted that the software enhanced the referrals process by further streamlining and organizing the patient referral process. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement and the National Patient Safety Foundation (2017) reviewed the referrals process in the ambulatory care setting and found that organizational leaders, EHR vendors, regulatory agencies, clinicians, and patients all play a role in creating a referrals system that is effective, safe, convenient, and patient-centered.",
