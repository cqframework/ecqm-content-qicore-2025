This value set is a subset of the &quot;Inpatient Encounter&quot; value set, excluding concepts that specifically refer to elective hospital admissions. Non-elective Inpatient Encounters include emergency, urgent, and unplanned admissions.\n\nThe &quot;Medication, Discharge&quot; datatype refers to the discharge medication list and is intended to express medications ordered for post-discharge use.\n\nThe denominator population includes patients with inpatient hospitalizations and patients from Acute Hospital Care at Home programs, who are treated and billed as inpatients but receive care in their home.\n\nThis dQM is an episode-based measure. An episode is defined as each inpatient hospitalization or encounter that ends during the measurement period. This FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure: CMS71v15.

It is one of several conditions and lifestyle factors that have been identified as risk factors for stroke. It has been estimated that over 2 million adults in the United States have NVAF (Kornej, 2020). While the median age of patients with atrial fibrillation is 75 years, the incidence increases with advancing age. For example, The Framingham Heart Study noted a dramatic increase in stroke risk associated with atrial fibrillation with advancing age, from 1.5% for those 50 to 59 years of age to 23.5% for those 80 to 89 years of age. Furthermore, a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are among a limited number of predictors of high stroke risk within the population of patients with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, much emphasis has been placed on identifying methods for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke as well as preventing first stroke. Prevention strategies focus on the modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, and atrial fibrillation. Analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy of warfarin in the primary prevention of thromboembolic stroke, found the relative risk of thromboembolic stroke was reduced by 68% for atrial fibrillation patients treated with warfarin. The administration of anticoagulation therapy, unless there are contraindications, is an established effective strategy in preventing recurrent stroke in high stroke risk-atrial fibrillation patients with TIA or prior stroke.</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Clinical Recommendation Statement</th>\n\n<td class=\"content-container\">The administration of anticoagulation therapy, unless there are contraindications, is an established effective strategy in preventing recurrent stroke in high stroke risk atrial fibrillation patients with TIA or prior stroke</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Supplemental Data Guidance</th>\n\n<td class=\"content-container\">For every patient evaluated by this measure also identify payer, race, ethnicity and sex; SDE Ethnicity-Patient's Ethnicity:\nHispanic or Latino\nNot Hispanic or Latino \n SDE Payer-Patient's Payer:\nCategories of types of health care payer entities as defined by the US Public Health Data Consortium SOP code system \n SDE Race-Patient's Race:\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\nAsian\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native\nOther Race\nWhite\nBlack or African American \n SDE Sex-Patient's Sex:\nGender identity restricted to only Male and Female used in administrative situations requiring a restriction to these two categories. \n </td>\n</tr>\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    <tr>\n\n<th colspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Measure Population Criteria (ID: Group_1)</th>\n\n</tr>\n  \n  \n    \n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Summary</th>\n\n<td class=\"content-container\">Ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter who are prescribed or continuing to take anticoagulation therapy at hospital discharge</td>\n</tr>\n\n  \n  \n  \n    <tr>\n      \n        \n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Initial Population</th>\n\n      \n      <td class=\"content-container\">\n        \n        <em>ID</em>: InitialPopulation_1\n        <br/>\n        \n        \n          <em>Description</em>:\n          <p style=\"white-space: pre-line\" class=\"tab-one\">Inpatient hospitalizations (non-elective admissions) for patients age 18 and older, discharged from inpatient care with a principal diagnosis of ischemic stroke, that ends during the measurement period</p>\n        \n        \n          \n            \n            <em>Logic Definition</em>: <a href=\"#cms71fhirstkanticoagafflutter-initial-population\">Initial Population</a> \n          \n        \n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  \n\n  \n    <tr>\n      \n        \n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Denominator</th>\n\n      \n      <td class=\"content-container\">\n        \n        <em>ID</em>: Denominator_1\n        <br/>\n        \n        \n          <em>Description</em>:\n          <p style=\"white-space: pre-line\" class=\"tab-one\">Inpatient hospitalizations for patients with a principal diagnosis of ischemic stroke, and a history of atrial ablation, or current or history of atrial fibrillation/flutter</p>\n        \n        \n          \n            \n            <em>Logic Definition</em>: <a href=\"#cms71fhirstkanticoagafflutter-denominator\">Denominator</a> \n          \n        \n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  \n\n  \n    <tr>\n      \n        \n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Denominator Exclusion</th>\n\n      \n      <td class=\"content-container\">\n        \n        <em>ID</em>: DenominatorExclusion_1\n        <br/>\n        \n        \n          <em>Description</em>:\n          <p style=\"white-space: pre-line\" class=\"tab-one\">- Inpatient hospitalizations for patients admitted for elective carotid intervention.

This value set is a subset of the \"Inpatient Encounter\" value set, excluding concepts that specifically refer to elective hospital admissions. Non-elective Inpatient Encounters include emergency, urgent, and unplanned admissions.\n\nThe \"Medication, Discharge\" datatype refers to the discharge medication list and is intended to express medications ordered for post-discharge use.\n\nThe denominator population includes patients with inpatient hospitalizations and patients from Acute Hospital Care at Home programs, who are treated and billed as inpatients but receive care in their home.\n\nThis dQM is an episode-based measure. An episode is defined as each inpatient hospitalization or encounter that ends during the measurement period. This FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure: CMS71v15.

  "rationale": "Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is a common arrhythmia and an important risk factor for stroke. It is one of several conditions and lifestyle factors that have been identified as risk factors for stroke. It has been estimated that over 2 million adults in the United States have NVAF (Kornej, 2020). While the median age of patients with atrial fibrillation is 75 years, the incidence increases with advancing age. For example, The Framingham Heart Study noted a dramatic increase in stroke risk associated with atrial fibrillation with advancing age, from 1.5% for those 50 to 59 years of age to 23.5% for those 80 to 89 years of age. Furthermore, a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are among a limited number of predictors of high stroke risk within the population of patients with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, much emphasis has been placed on identifying methods for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke as well as preventing first stroke. Prevention strategies focus on the modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, and atrial fibrillation. Analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy of warfarin in the primary prevention of thromboembolic stroke, found the relative risk of thromboembolic stroke was reduced by 68% for atrial fibrillation patients treated with warfarin. The administration of anticoagulation therapy, unless there are contraindications, is an established effective strategy in preventing recurrent stroke in high stroke risk-atrial fibrillation patients with TIA or prior stroke.",
