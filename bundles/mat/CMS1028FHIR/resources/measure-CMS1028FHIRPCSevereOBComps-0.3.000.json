This measure allows for 3 approaches to determine gestational age (GA) in the following order of precedence:\n\n1.  The GA is calculated using the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ReVITALize guidelines.*\n2.  When the calculated GA is not available, the GA is obtained from a discrete field in the electronic health record. The intent is to capture the last estimated GA in the interval starting 24 hours or less prior to delivery and ending before midnight on the same day of delivery.\n3.  The GA is based on ICD10 or SNOMED codes indicative of weeks gestation.  This option is only used when results from items #1 and #2 (see above) are not available.\n \n*ACOG ReVITALize Guidelines for Calculating Gestational Age (ACOG, 2014):      \n     \n               Gestational Age = (280-(Estimated Due Date minus Reference Date))/7\n\n--Estimated Due Date (EDD): The best obstetrical EDD is determined by last menstrual period if confirmed by early ultrasound or no ultrasound performed, or early ultrasound if no known last menstrual period or the ultrasound is not consistent with last menstrual period, or known date of fertilization (e.g., assisted reproductive technology) \n--Reference Date is the date on which you are trying to determine gestational age. For purposes of this eCQM, Reference Date would be the Date of Delivery.   \n\nNote however the calculation may yield a non-whole number, and gestational age should be rounded down to the nearest completed week. For example, an infant born on the 5th day of the 36th week (35 weeks and 5/7 days) is at a gestational age of 35 weeks, not 36 weeks.\n\nDefinition:\nFor this measure, specifications are modeled after the nationally available and adopted CDC definition for Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM) with the addition of maternal mortality. At times, we may refer to the CDC indicators of morbidity as SMM, but the outcome of the measure, which includes morbidity and mortality, is referred to as Severe Obstetric Complications (SOC).\n\nThis eCQM is an episode-based measure. An episode is defined as each inpatient hospitalization or encounter that ends during the measurement period.\n\nThis FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure CMS1028v4. Please refer to the HL7 QI-Core Implementation Guide (https://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU4.1.1/) for more information on QI-Core and mapping recommendations from QDM to QI-Core 4.1.1 (https://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU4.1.1/qdm-to-qicore.html).</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\n\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Effective Period</th>\n\n<td class=\"content-container\">2026-01-01..2026-12-31</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Measure Developer</th>\n\n<td class=\"content-container\">The Joint Commission</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Measure Developer</th>\n\n<td class=\"content-container\">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Measure Developer</th>\n\n<td class=\"content-container\">Yale New Haven Health Service Corporation/ Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Measure Steward</th>\n\n<td class=\"content-container\">The Joint Commission</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Copyright</th>\n\n<td class=\"content-container\">Measure specifications are in the Public Domain.\n\nLOINC(R) copyright 2004-2024 Regenstrief Institute, Inc.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2021) report that these rates have continued to trend upward in recent decades. Research indicates that the overall rate of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) increased by almost 200% between 1993 and 2014 to 144 per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations (CDC, 2021), with more than 25,000 women per year experiencing obstetric complications (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). Recent maternal mortality data from 2018 reveal that 658 women in the US died from maternal causes, resulting in a rate of 17.4 deaths per 100,000 live births, with 77% of the deaths attributed to direct obstetric causes like hemorrhage, preeclampsia, obstetric embolism, and other complications (Hoyert &amp; Minino, 2020). 144 per 10,000 women hospitalized for delivery have experienced SMM, including hemorrhage, embolism, hypertension, stroke, and other serious complications (CDC, 2021). Racial and ethnic disparities exist: Black women and Hispanic women are at a significantly higher risk for developing these complications than are Non-Hispanic White women (Leonard, Main, Scott, Profit, &amp; Carmichael, 2019). Increasing rates of SMM are resulting in increased healthcare costs, longer hospitalization stays and impacts on a woman's health (Callaghan, Creanga, &amp; Kuklina, 2012). \n\nThere is limited national evaluation of hospitals' performance on maternal morbidity and mortality although SMM is widely used at the population level. SMM is linked to maternal mortality, varies significantly among hospitals, and has significant racial/ethnic and urban/rural disparities. SMM is a cost driver for both Medicaid and commercial plans. This measure is important as it will assist in the discovery and understanding of SMM patterns that can lead to improvements in the safety and quality of maternal care necessary to reduce SMM rates.</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Clinical Recommendation Statement</th>\n\n<td class=\"content-container\">Healthy People 2030 Measure (MICH-05): Reduce severe maternal complications identified during delivery hospitalizations (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend identifying potential cases of severe maternal morbidity for further review, with a focus on outcomes and complications, and consider this an important step toward promoting safe obstetric care (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine, Kilpatrick, &amp; Ecker, 2016).</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n<tr>\n\n<th scope=\"row\" class=\"row-header\">Supplemental Data Guidance</th>\n\n<td class=\"content-container\">For every patient evaluated by this measure also identify payer, race, ethnicity and sex.

  "description": "Patients with severe obstetric complications that occur during the inpatient delivery hospitalization",
  "usage": "Note: This measure will be stratified by race/ethnicity and payer after measure submission.\n\nIn the case of multiple births, map the first delivery date/time (Baby A) as the delivery date/time for the encounter. This measure allows for 3 approaches to determine gestational age (GA) in the following order of precedence:\n\n1.  The GA is calculated using the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ReVITALize guidelines.*\n2.  When the calculated GA is not available, the GA is obtained from a discrete field in the electronic health record. The intent is to capture the last estimated GA in the interval starting 24 hours or less prior to delivery and ending before midnight on the same day of delivery.\n3.  The GA is based on ICD10 or SNOMED codes indicative of weeks gestation.  This option is only used when results from items #1 and #2 (see above) are not available.\n \n*ACOG ReVITALize Guidelines for Calculating Gestational Age (ACOG, 2014):      \n     \n               Gestational Age = (280-(Estimated Due Date minus Reference Date))/7\n\n--Estimated Due Date (EDD): The best obstetrical EDD is determined by last menstrual period if confirmed by early ultrasound or no ultrasound performed, or early ultrasound if no known last menstrual period or the ultrasound is not consistent with last menstrual period, or known date of fertilization (e.g., assisted reproductive technology) \n--Reference Date is the date on which you are trying to determine gestational age. For purposes of this eCQM, Reference Date would be the Date of Delivery.   \n\nNote however the calculation may yield a non-whole number, and gestational age should be rounded down to the nearest completed week. For example, an infant born on the 5th day of the 36th week (35 weeks and 5/7 days) is at a gestational age of 35 weeks, not 36 weeks.\n\nDefinition:\nFor this measure, specifications are modeled after the nationally available and adopted CDC definition for Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM) with the addition of maternal mortality. At times, we may refer to the CDC indicators of morbidity as SMM, but the outcome of the measure, which includes morbidity and mortality, is referred to as Severe Obstetric Complications (SOC).\n\nThis eCQM is an episode-based measure. An episode is defined as each inpatient hospitalization or encounter that ends during the measurement period.\n\nThis FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure CMS1028v4. Please refer to the HL7 QI-Core Implementation Guide (https://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU4.1.1/) for more information on QI-Core and mapping recommendations from QDM to QI-Core 4.1.1 (https://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU4.1.1/qdm-to-qicore.html).",

  "rationale": "The United States (US) experiences higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality than most other developed countries. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2021) report that these rates have continued to trend upward in recent decades. Research indicates that the overall rate of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) increased by almost 200% between 1993 and 2014 to 144 per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations (CDC, 2021), with more than 25,000 women per year experiencing obstetric complications (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). Recent maternal mortality data from 2018 reveal that 658 women in the US died from maternal causes, resulting in a rate of 17.4 deaths per 100,000 live births, with 77% of the deaths attributed to direct obstetric causes like hemorrhage, preeclampsia, obstetric embolism, and other complications (Hoyert & Minino, 2020). 144 per 10,000 women hospitalized for delivery have experienced SMM, including hemorrhage, embolism, hypertension, stroke, and other serious complications (CDC, 2021). Racial and ethnic disparities exist: Black women and Hispanic women are at a significantly higher risk for developing these complications than are Non-Hispanic White women (Leonard, Main, Scott, Profit, & Carmichael, 2019). Increasing rates of SMM are resulting in increased healthcare costs, longer hospitalization stays and impacts on a woman's health (Callaghan, Creanga, & Kuklina, 2012). \n\nThere is limited national evaluation of hospitals' performance on maternal morbidity and mortality although SMM is widely used at the population level. SMM is linked to maternal mortality, varies significantly among hospitals, and has significant racial/ethnic and urban/rural disparities. SMM is a cost driver for both Medicaid and commercial plans. This measure is important as it will assist in the discovery and understanding of SMM patterns that can lead to improvements in the safety and quality of maternal care necessary to reduce SMM rates.",
